Obviously using certificates for these devices is the answer so what I want to know is can I use a certificate for mobiles and a different authentication system for other devices. I know this should be possible but cannot find the answer outside of running 2 asa's one for authentication mobiles and the 2nd for laptop mobile warriors, realising I could user multiple contexts but this is a virtual solution of the 2 box solution, Ideally I would want a profile that if authentication a fails then it moves onto test 2 if that fails final is fail any thoughts?

537,2016,"Hi all, This question isn't really particularly tied to any Cisco VPN / firewall product. But I would really hope to seek clarifications with regards to the general workings of a VPN tunnel from gurus here.. So here we go... I understand that (encryption aside), VPN tunnels embeds the actual source and destination (e.g. internal network) of a network packet with the public internet address between the VPN client and the VPN server. For example, on site A, i would have a 192.168.10.0/24 private network and i would like VPN clients connections to site A to be part of this 192.168.10.0/24 network. The gateway for this network is a L3 coreswitch- 192.168.10.254 which will then routes to other internal network/resources. As shown in my illustration below, i have an internet router that does not support VPN, hence i have to setup another VPN behind it with a public IP untitled2.gif My question is-> if there is a route install in my VPN client with 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.10.254 Does that means my ""internet"" packet will still be send to the VPN server, but the VPN server will then ""unwrap"" it and ""forward"" it to the L3 coreswitch gateway IP- 192.168.10.254? e.g. embedded packet A from VPN client machine [src] [dest] [payload] [192.168.10.50] [192.168.4.3][icmp] final packet [public src][public dest][embbeded packet A] [63.216.23.24][202.202.202.10] [192.168.10.50][192.168.4.3][ICMP] q1) What i meant is, the final packet is send through the internet to the VPN server (202.202.202.10), how does the VPN server then carry on to forward the packet to the L3 gateway then? surely it need some sort of forwarding/routing capability right? In general how does, the embedded packet A get forwarded to the VPN server, then to the L3 core switch-> to the intended destination 192.168.4.3?-- or is it that i must setup/allocate an entire separate VPN subnet for the VPN client and VPN server; and the gateway for the VPN client to all the other internal networks will be to the VPN server (and not the L3 coreswitch), with the VPN server having the routes to another internal network through to the L3 coreswitch instead?

1247,2015,"Dear all, I've been struggling to understand some debug output from my ASA which has a VPN configured with a remote checkpoint. In short; the problem is within the P1 & P2 rekey timers. I've defined both timers as 28800 (8 hours). We've matched up these timers since Checkpoint firewalls will automatically delete P2 SA's after a P1 rekey. An ASA however will remain sending packets using the existing P2 SA until it's remaining lifetime runs out. Having said that; the IPSec tunnel will go down every 6 hours. This is strange, since the timers have been set to 8 hours. After grabbing a debug output from the ASA I've found these two messages within the output of a succesful tunnel coming up: 2015-12-22,""13:26:17"",""Local5"",""Debug"",""ASA-HOSTNAME"",""%ASA-7-715080: Group = REMOTE_PEER, IP = REMOTE_PEER, Starting P1 rekey timer: 21600 seconds."" 2015-12-22,""13:26:17"",""Local5"",""Debug"",""ASA-HOSTNAME"",""%ASA-7-715080: Group = REMOTE_PEER, IP = REMOTE_PEER, Starting P2 rekey timer: 24480 seconds."" This indicates that the rekey will take place before any of the actual defined timers run out. How is this possible? Running the 'show crypto ikev1 sa detail' and 'show crypto ipsec sa peer *.*.*.*' validate that the timers are 28800 seconds. After clearing the tunnels, the remaining lifetime also matches up on both P1 and P2 and will show a value higher than the ones set in the debug output. I'm wondering why these timer values are different in the debug logs opposite the actual configured values and the values produced by the show commands.

1397,2015,"Hi, I hope someone may be able to help with a really annoying problem. I recently installedAnyConnect VPN on aMacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2011). This machine has 4 user accounts on it, and VPN is visible in the Applications menu for each of them. On one account (of course the one where I actually need to have VPN functional), the software appears to install but is not functional when started. The program opens but the connection window does not, all the menu commands are surrounded by percent signs (see attached Problem screen cap 1) and most are inactive. On all other accounts, VPN is fully functional (see attached No Problem screen cap 2), the connection window opens as expected and I am able to connect to the remote resources that require VPN at my institution. This is true whether AnyConnect VPN was installed from within the problem account or another account. Given that only a single account has this problem, I think it is an account-specific setting (security or other) but have not been able to identify any differences in the security settings. Has anyone seen this problem with AnyConnect specifically and know what the issue is? Or know what the % signs in the menu might indicate about the source of the problem?

1402,2015,"I'm setting up Anyconnect to replace our Cisco IPsec VPN clients since they are end of life. A part of the process is to get an SSL cert and a FQDN to use for it. I've got that and it's applied to the ASA just fine. Now we don't get those warnings about it not being safe and such. The issue is that we have to use a non-standard port for the SSL VPN since 443 is already being forwarded to an internal device.I have unused public addresses at the outside interface of the ASA but I don't know how I could use them. I would like to have a different IP address for the SSL VPN so I don't have to mess with the port forward that is currently in place. I've read up on proxy arp but that seems like it could be problematic. I could have someone connect another cable to a different interface on the ASA (5512-X) and assign that interface the static I want for the VPN but I am not sure that will work well. We have site to site VPNs in place as well. Can I have the ASA listen on two different interfaces at the same time? Recap: IP 1- Primary NAT address, Site to Site tunnels terminate here, Some Cisco IPsec client VPNs terminate IP 2- Want to have all Anyconnect clients connect here, migrate all Cissco IPsec legacy clients until they are all on Anyconnect.

1585,2015,"Hello Everybody, I'm facing a problem with VPN service in ASA 5505. Initially I was using SSL Clientless VPN which was working absolutely fine, without any problems. Recently I have purchased AnyConnect Essentials License along with AnyConnect Mobile VPN License (for SSL Client-based VPN Service from desktop and mobile respectively) and have activated those keys' inside the firewall. After this I can only be able to login to Client-based VPN, using the AnyConnect client. Clientless VPN access is not permitting to login and shows an error (please check the attached screenshot). I have created two VPN profiles viz., basic (for clientless VPN) and rvsvpn (for client based VPN). Only to download the AnyConnect Client I can login to rvsvpn profile. But if I try to login using profile basic, it throws an error was what is showing in the exhibit. Please help me in this regard, as what can be done to use both the vpn login profile. Or is it that using AnyConnect disables the client-less access? Waiting for yours' help. Thanks in advance.

1794,2015,"Hi all, I am having trouble setting up anyconnect VPN on my router. I'm pre CCENT level and mostly followed a tutorial, but think I'm missing something simple here. It's a fairly simple setup on a Cisco 2851- one interface faces my 192.168.1.0/24 LAN, the other has a public IP. I've created a 192.168.2.0/24 network for VPN users, mainly to have Android phones connect from their mobile networks, and have access to servers/security cameras/etc using their local IPs. When my phone connects, it gets an IP and is connected, but does not communicate with my LAN properly. The VPN client can ping 192.168.1.254 (router's LAN IP)- but no other devices on the network. However, devices on my LAN can ping the VPN clients at their 192.168.2.x address. Here's a copy of my current config, I've sanitized certain items with #s. Also pasted my sh ip route under it.

1842,2015,"Hi, I have been looking into the ASA 5505 Hardware-Bundles and I have learnt that there are the following:- The Basic License, offering just 3 VLANs (the 3rd one restricted). Italso offersjust 2 SSL VPN AnyConnect Premium Licenses and 10 IPSec VPN (which comprises old Cisco VPN Client and EasyConnect), accounting both up to 10 VPNs. There are 3 types of Bundles, whose part numbers are: ** ASA5505-BUN-K9 --> which is the basic Bundle, offeringup to just 10 internal concurrent users **ASA5505-50-BUN-K9 -->offeringup to 50 internal concurrent users ** ASA5505-UL-BUN-K9 --> offeringunlimited internal concurrent users- The Security Plus License, offering up to 20 VLANs and unlimited internal concurrent users (regarding the Hardware-Bundle edition). Italso offersjust 2 SSL VPN AnyConnect Premium Licenses and 25 IPSec VPN (which comprises old Cisco VPN Client and EasyConnect), accounting both up to 25 VPNs.There is just one type of Bundle, whose part number is: ** ASA5505-SEC-BUN-K9 --> offering unlimited internal concurrent users. If you have the basic ASA5505-BUN-K9 Basic License and you want to upgrade to Security Plus License, you would activate 2 licenses: + the Security Plus License--> ASA5505-SEC-PL= (or the L-ASA5505-SEC-PL= if you want to receive it via email) + the Unlimited Users License--> ASA5505-SW-10-UL (as if the Security Plus License is not Hardware-Bundle, it does not come with unlimited users) and that's why it is much better to purchase the Security Plus License Hardware-Bundle right from the batthan upgrading later. This is as much as I could get, but I still have a couple of questions that I would like you to help me solve: QUESTION 1.- Is the above information right or is there anything wrong? QUESTION 2.- I have heard there is an AnyConnect Essentials VPN License offering up to 25 AnyConnect Essential Licenses concurrently, and I would like to know what is the difference between those licenses andAnyConnect Premium VPN Licenses? Will I be able to connect with an AnyConnect Essentials License through RDP? QUESTION 3.- I have also heard there is another bundle called ASA5505-SSL10-K9 offering up to 10 SSL VPN AnyConnect Licenses,which has been deprecated just recently. Was Security Plus License with unlimited users included in this Hardware-Bundle? QUESTION 4.- Alternatively, there is another license called ASA-SSL-10, which could be installed along with Security Plus License. Does it work the same way the the above Hardware-Bundle? QUESTION 5.- When reaching the limit of internal concurrent users permited, how long would it take to refresh the counter since a user gets out of the internal network?

The one that's available for download is 4.1(04011). Is that just a typo on the Cisco Download site?

Objective: Configure a Cisco 1700 router as a VPN server, which a Cisco Anyconnect client will VPN into. The VPN server is behind a NAT. Question 1: Does the Cisco Anyconnect client pull its entire configuration from the router? Do I just need to point at the right IP address and hit connect and it will figure out the rest? If not what additional client side configuration needs to be done? I noticed it tries to connect over port 443 to my router, but I'm not really sure why and I know my router isn't listening on that port so I know I'm missing something:-D. Question 2: What features specifically comprise easy vpn server? I'm confused as to exactly what it is. From what I can tell when you configure easy vpn server you're just configuring a regular VPN. Question 3: Does Cisco Easy VPN Remote have anything to do with Cisco Anyconnect or are they completely separate? Sorry about the newbie questions. It's really hard to understand the different systems and features on this one and the vast majority of the examples I found dealt with router to router VPNs rather than configurations just meant for end user computers, but I'll be the first to admit I'm new to this hahaha.

3127,2015,"Hi All, I am in the process of moving from the old IPsec VPN to the Cisco AnyConnect VPN. We wish to keep two factor authentication so I setup a Microsoft standalone CA (Can't use the ASA local CA as we have two ASA units in failover). The MS CA works fine, I issued the root CA certificate to the ASA and issued certificates from the CA to client machines which connect using AnyConnect no problem. My problem is that whatever I try I cannot get the ASA to retrieve the CRL. The many guides I have followed state that you simply add the CRL extension to the root certificate and then the ASA should pick this up using the 'Use CRL Distribution Point from the certificate' option. I have also tried manually adding the LDAP url and trying retrieval that way (although I am not sure on the url I used) and I still just get 'Unable to retrieve or verify CRL'. Does anyone have any experience with this or know what I'm doing wrong?

1630,2015,I'm in the process of establishing a new ASA VPN gateway (9.4.(1). All users are going to use the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client 3.1.1 and two factor authentication. I have discovered that a VPN client can establish a VPN connection and can successfully gain access to needed internal campus computer resources. Split tunneling is enabled so general internet access is via the clients ISP. All is working as expected. My issue is with our internal campus helpdesk support staff assisting the remote VPN users with local user problems on the PC's. Helpdesk staff can target the VPN connected device by IP address supplied by the ASA IP Pool. and can remote onto the local users PC with DameWare Mini Remote Control software. Because our remote user do not have local admin rights on the PC the helpdesk staff have to run a 'switch user' and log into the PC with their credentials. Immediately after the helpdesk staff login the VPN tunnel is removed from the VPN gateway. From what I understand from reading some documentation that this is normal default behavior. What I want to know is a way of turning off this feature? Short of making every one a local admin on their PC is there an alternative method of allowing support staff to gain access to the PC as themselves?,AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client and helpdesk support,https://supportforums.cisco.com/discussion/12624766/anyconnect-secure-mobility-client-and-helpdesk-support,,,,,,,,,3

1794,2015,"Hi all, I am having trouble setting up anyconnect VPN on my router. I'm pre CCENT level and mostly followed a tutorial, but think I'm missing something simple here. It's a fairly simple setup on a Cisco 2851- one interface faces my 192.168.1.0/24 LAN, the other has a public IP. I've created a 192.168.2.0/24 network for VPN users, mainly to have Android phones connect from their mobile networks, and have access to servers/security cameras/etc using their local IPs. When my phone connects, it gets an IP and is connected, but does not communicate with my LAN properly. The VPN client can ping 192.168.1.254 (router's LAN IP)- but no other devices on the network. However, devices on my LAN can ping the VPN clients at their 192.168.2.x address. Here's a copy of my current config, I've sanitized certain items with #s. Also pasted my sh ip route under it.

So, herein lies the issue...when I connect to the AnyConnect client, I get access to the internal network resources...no problem. I cannot, however, access the resources in the Amazon AWS cloud. I suspected that my split tunneling was to blame, so I went back and added the AWS ranges to the tunnel networks list. Unfortunately, this still does not work. So...is this even possible? It seems to me that there should be an internal route that I can setup on the ASA that would route the traffic bound for 172.16 addresses from the AnyConnect connection and back out through the IPSec tunnel to AWS. Does anybody have experience with this? We're running 9.1.3 on our 5512X if that makes a difference.

1247,2015,"Dear all, I've been struggling to understand some debug output from my ASA which has a VPN configured with a remote checkpoint. In short; the problem is within the P1 & P2 rekey timers. I've defined both timers as 28800 (8 hours). We've matched up these timers since Checkpoint firewalls will automatically delete P2 SA's after a P1 rekey. An ASA however will remain sending packets using the existing P2 SA until it's remaining lifetime runs out. Having said that; the IPSec tunnel will go down every 6 hours. This is strange, since the timers have been set to 8 hours. After grabbing a debug output from the ASA I've found these two messages within the output of a succesful tunnel coming up: 2015-12-22,""13:26:17"",""Local5"",""Debug"",""ASA-HOSTNAME"",""%ASA-7-715080: Group = REMOTE_PEER, IP = REMOTE_PEER, Starting P1 rekey timer: 21600 seconds."" 2015-12-22,""13:26:17"",""Local5"",""Debug"",""ASA-HOSTNAME"",""%ASA-7-715080: Group = REMOTE_PEER, IP = REMOTE_PEER, Starting P2 rekey timer: 24480 seconds."" This indicates that the rekey will take place before any of the actual defined timers run out. How is this possible? Running the 'show crypto ikev1 sa detail' and 'show crypto ipsec sa peer *.*.*.*' validate that the timers are 28800 seconds. After clearing the tunnels, the remaining lifetime also matches up on both P1 and P2 and will show a value higher than the ones set in the debug output. I'm wondering why these timer values are different in the debug logs opposite the actual configured values and the values produced by the show commands.

1345,2015,"Dear community We are in the process of migrating from the old Cisco VPN Client 5 to Cisco AnyConnect. I have a couple of ASA-5510 running 9.1(1) code with a Base license, and in current setup all remote users log into the VPN using standard IKE/IPSec methods from their laptops (no split tunneling, nothing fancy). The VPN Client currenly has a profile which is imported into each user's laptop and has a pre-shared key stored, the solution works fine. Management decided to go for the Plus version of AnyConnect, rather than Apex which I believe satisfies all our requirements (overview here: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/vpn_client/anyconnect/anyconnect40/feature/guide/anyconnect40features.html). I have three questions about migrating from VPN Client to AnyConnect: 1) currently my ASA shows that AnyConnect is disabled (see attached screenshot of show version). Do I need to upgrade the license on my ASA? If so does that come with AnyConnect or do I need to order it separately? 2) is it possible to use the VPN profile from VPN Client with AnyConnect or do I need to create a new one? 3) can someone direct me to a configuration guide for remote access VPN using the AnyConnect client rather than the old VPN Client? Are there any caveats / gotchas I should be aware of? Thanks a lot!

675,2016,"Hi guys, With a Cisco ASA5515, two VPN configured, one for user access and another VPN S2S, is it possible to enforce to the user's VPN config to only allow a specific encryption policy without affecting the S2S VPN? Let's say, I want to enforce only to the VPN users the ""crypto ikev1 policy 100"", (by default is the preferred among the others), but not allowing less secure policies such as ""crypto ikev1 policy 200"" which uses less secure key lenght? Our VPN clients supports this enhanced sec. policy, but I do not want to allow VPN users to configure in their workstations less secure protocols and ciphersuites. The S2S vpn uses a less secure configuration, but I can't change it, so the deal is to enforce this policy only to the user's VPN without affecting the S2S.

545,2016,"Hi All, I'm scratching my head on this one. I am trying to set up a VPN tunnel between a Cisco 2801 (my end) and a Sonicwall TZ215 (remote end). We seem to be getting through Phase 1 just fine, it keeps tanking on Phase 2. There is no conflict between the local and remote network schemes, so I'd rather avoid NAT and just be able to hit the remote server by the private side address. I have a border router (Cisco 2801) that I keep the VPNs on, and a Cisco PIX below that. Traffic is flagged in my PIX to head out our fiber rather than the default route whenever it needs to go over aVPN, it's definitely taking the right path out. On my PIX I do have this in my NAT0, though I've been doing all tests from the Cisco 2801 hoping to just get the tunnel up first without overcomplicating things. I've got 2 other VPNs running on this device, one using 3DES and one using AES, Ijust copied from the config for a very similar working VPN (changing the IPs and policy number). When using 3DES it seems to get through Phase 1 just fine, fails at Phase 2. When using AES it fails at Phase 1.

3181,2015,"Hi all,  i am having this interesting problem that drives me crazy whole day. I have ASA 5505 (ver 9) where i configured site-to-site VPN to other router and that works. Then i configured L2TP IPsec VPN on ASA with split tunneling and i can reach my local network. The problem is when i am trying to reach that remote network that is behind that site-to-site VPN. Whatever i do, i am not able to reach that network. This same exact setup works on different ASA with AnyConnect VPN.  So this is what i did: 1) Add VPN subnet as 2nd SA to existing site-to-site VPN 2) Configured NAT exemption for VPN subnet when going to remote subnet 3) Published that remote subnet to VPN client.

2972,2015,"Could anyone please help me with the detail explanation about? GRE over IPSEC vs IPSEC over GRE? If possible please share me some example with the IP header (like source ip can visible & Tunnel IP encapsulated) with detail example like a source to destination more thank full…. Which Tunnel gets up first GRE or IPSEC? How IPSEC works with multicast protocol? GRE tunnel how it’s works in the cloud? ISP has to be done at their end GRE tunnel how the trace works because while tracing only shows the next hop ip(destination)? IPSEC Tunnel mode which header will be visible, I seen new ip header would be added so what info available in that header? IPSEC transport mode which header can be visible, what are the info in available in the header?",IPSEC & GRE,https://supportforums.cisco.com/discussion/12429646/ipsec-gre,,,,,,,,,3
